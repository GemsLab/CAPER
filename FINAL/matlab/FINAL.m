function S = FINAL(A1, A2, N1, N2, E1, E2, H, alpha, maxiter, tol)
% Description:
%   The algorithm is the generalized attributed network alignment algorithm.
%   The algorithm can handle the cases no matter node attributes and/or edge
%   attributes are given. If no node attributes or edge attributes are given,
%   then the corresponding input variable of the function is empty, e.g.,
%   N1 = [], E1 = {}.
%   The algorithm can handle either numerical or categorical attributes
%   (feature vectors) for both edges and nodes.
%
%   The algorithm uses cosine similarity to calculate node and edge feature
%   vector similarities. E.g., sim(v1, v2) = <v1, v2>/(||v1||_2*||v2||_2).
%   For categorical attributes, this is still equivalent to the indicator
%   function in the original published paper.
%
% Input:
%   A1, A2: Input adjacency matrices with n1, n2 nodes
%   N1, N2: Node attributes matrices, N1 is an n1*K matrix, N2 is an n2*K
%         matrix, each row is a node, and each column represents an
%         attribute. If the input node attributes are categorical, we can
%         use one hot encoding to represent each node feature as a vector.
%         And the input N1 and N2 are still n1*K and n2*K matrices.
%         E.g., for node attributes as countries, including USA, China, Canada,
%         if a user is from China, then his node feature is (0, 1, 0).
%         If N1 and N2 are emtpy, i.e., N1 = [], N2 = [], then no node
%         attributes are input.
%
%   E1, E2: a L*1 cell, where E1{i} is the n1*n1 matrix and nonzero entry is
%         the i-th attribute of edges. E2{i} is same. Similarly,  if the
%         input edge attributes are categorical, we can use one hot
%         encoding, i.e., E1{i}(a,b)=1 if edge (a,b) has categorical
%         attribute i. If E1 and E2 are empty, i.e., E1 = {} or [], E2 = {}
%         or [], then no edge attributes are input.
%
%   H: a n2*n1 prior node similarity matrix, e.g., degree similarity. H
%      should be normalized, e.g., sum(sum(H)) = 1.
%   alpha: decay factor
%   maxiter, tol: maximum number of iterations and difference tolerance.
%
% Output:
%   S: an n2*n1 alignment matrix, entry (x,y) represents to what extend node-
%    x in A2 is aligned to node-y in A1
